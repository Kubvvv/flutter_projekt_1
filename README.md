# **Projekt 1: To-Do List**

A simple Flutter application to manage tasks. The app allows users to add tasks, mark tasks as done, move tasks back to "To-Do," and delete tasks. Tasks are dynamically categorized into "To-Do Tasks" and "Done Tasks" for better organization.

## **Features**

- Add new tasks to the "To-Do" list.
- Mark tasks as done and move them to the "Done Tasks" section.
- Undo completed tasks and move them back to the "To-Do" section.
- Delete tasks from either list.
- Automatically disables the "Add Task" button when the input field is empty.
- Dynamically updates the UI to reflect changes.
